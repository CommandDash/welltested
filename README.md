## Generate and Configure API Key

### üóùÔ∏è Generate API Key

Welltested is completely free for individual developers. To create an account, please [sign up here](https://www.welltested.ai/#pricing).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configure API Key

Create a `.env` file in root of your project, and add your key received in the email.

```
WELLTESTED_API=YOUR_API_KEY
```
We uses `dotenv` to retrive API Key. Once `.env` file is created, please declare it as an asset in `pubspec.yaml` to make is accessible to the package.

```yaml
assets:
  - .env
```

## Let's create tests

 Add the `@Welltested()` annotation to the class whose methods are to be tested.

```dart
@Welltested()
class Auth {
    Future<void> logInUser() {...}
    Future<void> logOutUser() {...}
}
```

In the above case, it will generate unit tests for `logInUser` and `logOutUser` methods of `Auth` class.

### Exclude Methods

By default, all methods in an annotated class are included. To exclude any method from testing, add their name to the `excludedMethods` list in the `Welltested` annotation.

```dart
@Welltested(excludedMethods: ['logOutUser'])
class Auth {
    Future<void> logInUser() {...}
    Future<void> logOutUser() {...}
}
```

In the above case, it will not create unit tests for¬†`logOutUser`¬†method.

### Custom Testcases

To specify custom testcases for any method, use `@Testcases()` annotation. 

```dart
@Welltested()
class Auth {
    @Testcases(['Throws exception when email is empty'])
    Future<User> logInUser() {...}
}
```
